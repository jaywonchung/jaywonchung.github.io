Two months ago, I began mentoring a Master's student who reached out to my advisor asking for collaboration opportunities.
The student showed interest in [Zeus](https://ml.energy/zeus), so as the first project, we decided to extend Zeus to a single-node multi-GPU setting.

As a mentor, my task was to figure out missing pieces of knowledge in the student, provide material to study or come up with Google search keywords for knowledge that even I do not know, answer questions, collaboratively design solutions, and provide feedback.
While I wasn't doing any *actual* work, the sequence of tasks was actually very difficult to satisfactorily perform because of the very fact that I wasn't doing any actual work.
That is, I was supposed to have better foresight into what would happen if we were to proceed in a certain direction without a complete picture of what's going on, or my mentee risks hitting a hard wall.
Going through all this, I felt very happy and proud when the feature developed by my mentee was merged into Zeus, even if I didn't do any actual work.

While the mentorship itself did not add anything tangible to my own research, it surprisingly helped with doing research, because I learned two important things from this experience.

First, I understood how difficult it would be for my advisor to advise me.
The case of me and my mentee was simply developing a moderately-sized software feature, and I could reasonably predict what would happen along the way and how things will look like in the end.
However, research is inherently uncertain; you never know if the hole you're digging is your grave.
Yet, PhD students expect their advisors to provide advice that is roughly in the right direction.
I have come to understand that not even the best professors can know with confidence that the way the student is headed is a good direction, and how incredibly good my advisor is in that he usually provides advice that ends up being correct.

Moreover, I now understand the mental pressure of providing advice.
Even if I wasn't entirely sure about the advice I was giving to my mentee, I still needed to at least *look* confident in order to give faith and motivation to my mentee.
Also, it was obvious that if I ended up pointing my mentee towards a hard wall, my mentee will feel sad.
I came to appreciate the weight of the advices that my advisor gives me.

Second, mentoring helped me understand the perspective of my advisor.
One was that even I could immediately figure out how much time my mentee invested into the project this week.
So I realized that how much time I spent would be even more obvious from the perspective of my advisor.

A more important realization was that in many cases, when my mentee asks for clarification about my proposal of doing something, I fail to give good answers because I myself was operating on top of logical guesses and inexplicable instincts.
Thus, putting myself in the shoes of my advisor, instead of interrogating my advisor about the details behind the advice, I rather tried to throw why I think my advisor made such a proposal in the form of a question.
Then, my advisor would answer whether he agrees with what I said, and sometimes he could even make better proposals based on the extra information I provided.

All in all, before this mentorship experience, my perception of mentoring was that it's only good for me if it ends with some nice tangible outcome in a reasonable amount time.
However, now I feel like the process of mentorship teaches me a lot about the relationship between me and my advisor, and allows me to improve the productivity of the meetings I have with my advisor.
And moreover, mentoring itself was an extremely rewarding process, where I could interact with enthusiastic juniors that are interested in my research.
