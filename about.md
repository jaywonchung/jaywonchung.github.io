Currently studying for a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University, South Korea. Along with electrical engineering, I also have great interest in computer science.

I plan to study on through my degree and look for quality internships during vacations. After I graduate, I seek to study abroad at the USA in the field of EECS.
