A senior student majoring Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University, South Korea. I have great interest in computer science and computer engineering.

I plan to study on through my degree and look for research opportunities. I will be applying for a Ph.D. position in the USA this year(2020). 

When I'm free (and actually even when I'm not), I play the guitar. I've been playing fingerstyle since middle school.
