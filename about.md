Currently studying for a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University, South Korea. Along with electrical engineering, I also have great interest in computer science.

I plan to study on through my degree and look for research opportunities during vacations. I will be applying for a Ph.D. position in the USA this year(2020).
